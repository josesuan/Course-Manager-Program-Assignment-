Sprint Retrospective  (1st Sprint) 

STARTS
-Learn how to share code on GitHub projects. 
-Read through the updated mark scheme.
-Update burndown chart to Gordanâ€™s example.
-Complete user stories (in progress) section.
-Update daily scrum/burndown chart.


STOP

-We need to stop improperly saving our code as we lost our first sprint code and we need start saving our progress using GitHub.  
-We need to divide task properly for each member, so we have less downtime, and everyone gets guidance from the main programme. 
-Not everyone in our group has kept daily scrums updated, so we need to urge everyone to log their progress.  


Continue
-Release Burndown chart is going well as we know how to update it 
-Making UML class diagram before coding.
-Put in the extra time outside class and to stay up to date.
